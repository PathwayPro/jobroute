## PROMPT
As an experienced nursing educator, provide a step-by-step roadmap for self-education in Critical Care Nursing. The roadmap should consist of 5 milestone topics that gradually increase in complexity, covering essential knowledge and skills related to Critical Care Nursing. Each step should build upon the previous one.

Step 2 - Study of major organ systems and their functions.
Step 3 - In-depth exploration of cellular and tissue physiology.
Step 4 - Integration of anatomical and physiological concepts to understand body systems.
Step 5 - Advanced topics such as neuroanatomy and pathophysiology.
## RESULT
Step 1 - Introduction to Critical Care Nursing: Basic concepts and principles of critical care nursing, including the role of the critical care nurse, assessment techniques, and common critical care interventions.
Step 2 - Respiratory System: In-depth study of respiratory anatomy and physiology, including assessment and management of respiratory disorders, mechanical ventilation, and oxygenation.
Step 3 - Cardiovascular System: Comprehensive understanding of cardiovascular anatomy and physiology, including assessment and management of cardiac disorders, hemodynamic monitoring, and pharmacological interventions.
Step 4 - Neurological System: Advanced knowledge of neurological anatomy and physiology, including assessment and management of neurological disorders, intracranial pressure monitoring, and neuroprotective strategies.
Step 5 - Multi-System Failure: Integration of knowledge from previous milestones to understand the complexities of multi-system failure, including assessment and management of sepsis, acute renal failure, and other critical conditions.
